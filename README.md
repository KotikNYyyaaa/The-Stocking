This is my first Rain World mod! (Well, the one that worked and I decided to publish it) It's a work in progress, I finally managed to figure out at least part of how SlugBase works.

I don't know C# code at all, so don't expect perfection.

You can certainly offer to help me, but I doubt we'll get along.

I'm having a hard time working with all this because I live in Russia - and as it turns out, I don't know English at all.
